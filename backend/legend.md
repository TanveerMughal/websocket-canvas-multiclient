# Backend Code Legend

This document provides an overview of the backend code structure, key components, and potential areas for refactoring.

## Code Structure

-   **`src/`**: The main source code for the application.
    -   **`main.ts`**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, the Socket.IO server, and handles all the socket events.

## Refactoring Suggestions

-   **Code Organization**: As the application grows, consider splitting the socket event handlers into separate files or modules to improve organization.
-   **State Management**: The current state is stored in a simple in-memory array. For a production application, you would want to use a more robust solution like Redis or a database to store the state.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling, such as logging errors to a file or a monitoring service.
-   **Scalability**: For a large number of concurrent users, you would need to scale the backend horizontally by running multiple instances of the server and using a Redis adapter for Socket.IO to share the state between them.
